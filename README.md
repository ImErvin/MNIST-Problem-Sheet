## MNIST Problem Sheet
This is a simple MNIST problem sheet. The aim of this problem sheet is to get a foot in the door and start learning about computer vision.This problem sheet was created by [Ian Mcloughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin) as part of our emerging technologies module in college.

You can find my solutions to each of these problems in this repository.

### What is MNIST?
MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a sub data set of NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology), a large database of handwritten digits. MNIST is used to train image processing systems and is basically the "hello world" of computer vision.

MNIST contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Training images are used to train a system, and testing images are used to test the trained system.

### Where does the MNIST dataset come from?
The set of images in the MNIST database is a combination of two of NIST's databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 consist of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau, respectively.[1]
